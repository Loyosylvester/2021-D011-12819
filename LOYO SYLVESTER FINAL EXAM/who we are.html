        <h3> Our Mandate</h3>
        <p>UNOC was incorporated as a limited liability company wholly owned by the Government of Uganda in June 2015.</p>
        <p>Our overall function is to handle the Government of Uganda’s commercial interests in the petroleum sub-sector and to ensure State participation in petroleum activities.</p>
        <p>The company is also mandated to investigate and propose new upstream, midstream, and downstream ventures initially locally and eventually internationally.</p>

        <h3>Our brand history</h3>
        <p>On appointment as the inaugural Chief Executive Officer in August 2016, Eng. Dr. Josephine Wapakabulo visualised the need for a company logo and identity.</p>
        <p>The logo had to incorporate the colours of the national flag – Black, Yellow and Red. The bird is the Crested Crane which is the national bird and reflects the one of our core values – concern for environment.</p>
        <p>The shape of the logo is an oil drop, and red at the bottom represents gas.
